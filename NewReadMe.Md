What went Awesome?
> Using GridItemsLayout Orientation as Vertical with Span 2 was surprisingly awesome. :)

What didn't go well?
> I have been working on zizzag collection View and there should be another way we can do to replicate Pinterest UI's using Collection View.
As i was not able to remove those spaces between two items as shown in the above image.

How is the performance?
> It's awesome

How did i made this type of UI ?
> It was really simple i just added collection view in app used margin converters and passed the margin from ViewModels to place those images to center.
