       "Meet" : "Stevie Girl is a large dilute tortoiseshell with extremely soft fur, who tips the scales at a substantial 14 pounds. Being blind, her vision impairment isnt readily apparent since she behaves very much like a normal cat when she is in her accustomed surroundings. She likes to play and is able to jump up on furniture and make her way around without bumping into things. She is very sweet, but can be feisty and energetic, as well as loving and full of purrs.",
